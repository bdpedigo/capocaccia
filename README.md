Demonstration of accessing and manipulating some data from the [MICrONS project](https://www.microns-explorer.org/).

More thorough exposition and examples using CAVE are available [here](https://tutorial.microns-explorer.org/).

The CAVE documentation is available [here](https://github.com/CAVEconnectome/CAVEclient/).
